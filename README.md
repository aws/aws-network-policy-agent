# aws-network-policy-agent
Amazon EKS Network Policy Agent is a daemonset that is responsible for enforcing configured network policies on the cluster. Network policy support is a feature of the [Amazon VPC CNI](https://github.com/aws/amazon-vpc-cni-k8s). 

[Network Policy Controller](https://github.com/aws/amazon-network-policy-controller-k8s/) resolves the configured network policies and publishes the resolved endpoints via Custom CRD (`PolicyEndpoints`) resource. Network Policy agent derives the endpoints from PolicyEndpoint resources and enforces them via eBPF probes attached to pod's host Veth interface.

Starting with Amazon VPC CNI v1.14.0, Network Policy agent will be automatically installed. Review the instructions in the [EKS User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cni-network-policy.html).

## Getting Started
You’ll need a Kubernetes cluster version 1.25+ to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.

**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

## Prerequisites 
 - You need to install [Network Policy Controller](https://github.com/aws/amazon-network-policy-controller-k8s/) in your cluster before you can enable the feature in VPC CNI. When you create a new Amazon EKS cluster, the controller will be automatically installed in EKS control plane.
 - Network Policy Agent expects the BPF FS (`/sys/fs/bpf`) to be mounted. If you rely on EKS AMIs, all v1.27+ EKS AMIs will mount BPF FS by default. For v1.25 and v1.26 clusters, EKS AMIs above version https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-eks-ami/releases/tag/v20230703 will mount the BPF FS by default.
 - PolicyEndpoint CRD needs to be installed in the cluster. Installing Network Policy Controller will automatically install the CRD.

## Setup
Download the latest version of the [yaml](https://github.com/aws/amazon-vpc-cni-k8s/tree/release-1.14/config) and apply it to the cluster.

Please refer to [EKS User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cni-network-policy.html) on how to enable the feature.

### Network Policy Agent Configuration flags
---

#### `enable-network-policy`

Type: Boolean

Default: false

Set this flag to `true` to enable the Network Policy feature support.

#### `enable-cloudwatch-logs`

Type: Boolean

Default: false

Network Policy Agent provides an option to stream policy decision logs to Cloudwatch. For EKS clusters, the policy logs will be located under `/aws/eks/<cluster-name>/cluster/` and for self-managed K8S clusters, the logs will be placed under `/aws/k8s-cluster/cluster/`. By default, Network Policy Agent will log policy decision information for individual flows to a file on the local node (`/var/run/aws-routed-eni/network-policy-agent.log`).

This feature requires you to provide relevant Cloudwatch permissions to `aws-node` pod via the below policy.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "logs:DescribeLogGroups",
                "logs:CreateLogGroup",
                "logs:CreateLogStream",
                "logs:PutLogEvents"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### `enable-ipv6`

Type: Boolean

Default: false

Network Policy agent can operate in either IPv4 or IPv6 mode. Setting this flag to `true` in the manifest will configure it in IPv6 mode.

## Network Policy Agent CLI
The Amazon VPC CNI plugin for Kubernetes installs eBPF SDK collection of tools on the nodes. You can use the eBPF SDK tools to identify issues with network policies. For example, the following command lists the programs that are running on the node.

**Note:**: To run this CLI, you can use any method to connect to the node. CLI binary is located at `/opt/cni/bin`.

**Usage**:

```
./aws-eks-na-cli ebpf -h
Dump all ebpf related data

Usage:
  aws-eks-na-cli ebpf [flags]
  aws-eks-na-cli ebpf [command]

Aliases:
  ebpf, ebpf

Available Commands:
  dump-maps       Dump all ebpf maps related data
  loaded-ebpfdata Dump all ebpf related data
  maps            Dump all ebpf maps related data
  progs           Dump all ebpf program related data
```

- Load all eBPF programs managed by Network Policy Agent

   ./aws-eks-na-cli ebpf progs

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
